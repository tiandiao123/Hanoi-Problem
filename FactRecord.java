     *3* resume location
      Note that any method that contains a recursive call will have at 
         least two possible "resume" locations. 
      1 - The start of the method (entry point when the method is 
       first invoked)
       2 - The location immediately after returning from the 
        recursive call
       However, methods that have more than one recursive call, will have
      an additional entry point for each additional recursive call. 
       This is needed because once a recursive call is complete, the 
       program must "know" where to come back to in order to resume 
      execution immediately after the point of the recursive call
